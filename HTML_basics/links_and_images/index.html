    <!-- This is the anchor tag used to link pages, images, any resource on the internet or in the server running the web page/app 
    * <a></>a> is the anchor tag, href is the attribute that specifies the link destination 
   * href can take a URL (link to a resource on the internet) or a file path (link to a resource in the server running the web page/app)

   * target="_blank" opens the link in a new tab

   * rel="noopener noreferrer" is a security measure to prevent the new page from having access to the original page via the window.opener property

   * The text between the opening and closing anchor tags is the clickable text that will take you to the link destination

    <a href="https://www.github.com/nuelwhite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>

    <!-- There are two types of links:
     * Absolute links -> links to pages on other websites like the example above (scheme://domain/path)
     
     * Relative links -> links to pages located on our own websites

      <!-- Add images 
       We add images to a web page using the <img> tag, it is a void element, and requires no closing tag.
       
       We embed an image into the src attribute, it takes the url of the image-->
